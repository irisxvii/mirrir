# Mirror-Mirror
## About the project..

The idea is simple: to make a mirror that'd generate compliments based on your looks. This is an **IoT-based smart mirror** which will compliment you when it sees you. This idea was inspired by the fairy tale Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. In the story, the evil Queen has a mirror that tells her she's the most beautiful. Like that, this mirror tells you how you look based on your appearance. To do this, we can use the help of **GPT, APIs, and cloud-based storage** for data storage.

## Hardware Components:

1. **Proximity Sensor**: Helps detect motion and presence of a human.
2. **Camera**: Captures and uploads images to the web.
3. **Raspberry Pi 3 or higher**: Acts as the main control unit with Wi-Fi capabilities.
4. **Output Device**: Screen or speaker.
5. **A mirror**.

This idea is a far stretched one with the need of many trial and error runs and a dataset and database. But because of the time constraint and limited amount of components, we created a prototype which runs with pre loaded API generated compliments, and a sensor to detect presence, and a lcd screen to display the randomly generated compliment.

Since this project was made for the make-a-thon Useless Project, we changed the compliments to roasts.
