About the project..

The idea is simple, to make a mirror that'd generate compliments based on your looks. 
This is a iot based smart mirror which will compliment you when it sees you. This idea was inspired by the fairy tale Snow White and Seven Dwarfs. In the story, the evil Queen has a mirror that tells her she's the most beautiful. Like that this mirror tells you how you look based on your appearance. To do this we can use the help of gpt, API's and cloud based storage, for data storage.
The Hardwares that can be used are; 
1. Any kind of proximity sensor to help detect motion and presence of human.
2. A camera to capture and upload image to the web.
3. Raspberry Pi 3 or higher with wifi capabilities used as the main control unit.
4. A output device, screen or speaker.
5. A mirror.

This idea is a far stretched one with the need of many trial and error runs and a dataset and database. But because of the time constraint and limited amount of components, we created a prototype which runs with pre loaded API generated compliments, and a sensor to detect presence, and a lcd screen to display the randomly generated compliment.

Since this project was made for the make-a-thon Useless Project, we changed the compliments to roasts.
